================================================================================

DESCRIPTION:
This test checks if the API is running and healthy. It returns basic information
about the API status, version, total documents in the database, and current 
timestamp. This is useful for monitoring and debugging.

COMMAND:
curl.exe "http://localhost:8000/"

OUTPUT:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "total_documents": 6,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-04T14:51:40.912499"
}

NOTES:
- This is a GET request to the root endpoint
- Returns HTTP 200 OK if the server is running
- Shows total_documents count in the database
- Timestamp is in ISO 8601 format
- Useful for load balancer health checks in production
